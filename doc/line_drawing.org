* Basics and assumptions
Line endpoints are integer coordinates.

(0, 0) is top-left of the screen.

Coordinates refer to pixel centers.

Bresenham is the basis.

We have direct access to frame buffer memory, there is no need to go through a separate "drawPixel" function.

We can therefore address a pixel either as an array index into the frame buffer (treated as an array) or as a complete address to the pixel's memory location.

We are not anti-aliasing lines, since we have a palette based color scheme

* Test routine

I'd prefer to put this in init.f but there seems to be a length limitation there.
