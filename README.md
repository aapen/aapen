NOTE: this fork is currently broken. I'm attempting to port this from RPi 1 to RPi 4... it's a totally different architecture so the boot code is different, the interrupt controller is different, timers are different, etc.

# Raspberry Pi JonesFORTH O/S

A bare-metal operating system for Raspberry Pi,
based on [_Jonesforth-ARM_](https://github.com/M2IHP13-admin/JonesForth-arm).

_Jonesforth-ARM_ is an ARM port, by M2IHP'13 class members listed in `AUTHORS`, of _x86 JonesForth_.

_x86 JonesForth_ is a Linux-hosted FORTH presented in a Literate Programming style
by Richard W.M. Jones <rich@annexia.org> originally at <http://annexia.org/forth>.
Comments embedded in the original provide an excellent FORTH implementation tutorial.
See the `/annexia/` directory for a copy of this original source.

The algorithm for our unsigned DIVMOD instruction is extracted from 'ARM
Software Development Toolkit User Guide v2.50' published by ARM in 1997-1998

Firmware files to make bootable images are maintained at <https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware>.
See the `/firmware/` directory for local copies used in the build process.


## What is this ?

_pijFORTHos_ is a bare-metal FORTH interpreter for the [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) (original, Model B).
It follows the general strategy given by David Welch's
[excellent examples](https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi).
A simple [bootloader](/doc/bootload.md#bootloader) is built in,
supporting XMODEM uploads of new bare-metal kernel images.

The interpreter uses the RPi serial console (115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit).
If you have _pijFORTHos_ on an SD card in the RPi,
you can connect it to another machine (even another RPi)
using a [USB-to-Serial cable](http://www.adafruit.com/products/954).
When the RPi is powered on (I provide power through the cable),
a terminal program on the host machine allows access to the FORTH console.

## Board support

Currently supports Raspberry Pi 1a+ only.

## Build and run instructions

If you are building on the RPi, just type:

    $ make clean all

If you're cross-compiling, type:

    $ CROSS=arm-linux-gnueabi- clean all

...where CROSS corresponds to the ARM cross-compiler
toolchain you have installed.

If you can't compile (or cross-compile) from source,
you can use the pre-built `kernel.img` file.

Next, copy the firmware and kernel to a blank SD card, for example:

    $ cp firmware/* /media/<SD-card>/
    $ cp kernel.img /media/<SD-card>/

The end state for the SD card is to have a FAT32 filesystem on it with the following files:

    bootcode.bin
    start.elf
    kernel.img

Put the prepared SD card into the RPi,
connect the USB-to-Serial cable
(see [RPi Serial Connection](http://elinux.org/RPi_Serial_Connection) for more details),
and power-up to the console.

To get to the console, you'll need to connect. Here are two ways to try:

    $ minicom -b 115200 -o -D <device>

Where `<device>` is something like `/dev/ttyUSB0` or similar
(wherever you plugged in your USB-to-Serial cable).

Alternatively, if `minicom` is not working for you, try using `screen`:

    $ screen <device> 115200

Where `<device>` is, again, something like `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

The console will be waiting for an input, press `<ENTER>`. You should then see:

    pijFORTHos <version> sp=0x00008000

## Running under emulation

You can install the QEMU ARM support package, then run:

    make emulate
    
This will start `qemu-system-arm` (32-bit mode) emulating a Raspberry Pi model 1a+
with its serial I/O connected to your terminal's stdin/stdout.

(This seems to work right up until GPIO or timers are needed. The blinker sample hangs on `3 secs us 33 EMIT`.)

## Where to go from HERE ?

With FORTH REPL running, try typing:

    HEX 8000 DECIMAL 128 DUMP

You should see something like:

For something a little more interesting, try the [GPIO Morse Code](/doc/blinker.md) tutorial.

The [FORTH reference](/doc/forth.md) page describes the FORTH words available in _pijFORTHos_.

The [Bootloader](/doc/bootload.md) page describes the memory layout and boot process.

There is a persistent thread on the Rasberry Pi forums with a useful collection of
