* OPEN Boot fail on HW if ~debug.serial_log_level~ is 2 or greater
Symptoms:
- kinfo call from ~bcm_mailbox.zig:363~ causes panic loop on ~debug.zig:24~
* OPEN Flaky boot on HW
Symptoms:
- Stepping through ~kernelInit~ one line at a time via openocd and gdb, boot succeeds and gets to prompt.
- Some lines, like the call to ~diagnostics~ at ~main.zig:80~ result in a corrupted PC
- Timing problem? Interrupts versus the stack?
* OPEN DMA sometimes doesn't complete on HW
Symptoms:
- Using
Repo:
Run the following commands from ~OK>>~
#+begin_src
0 0x4000 fb fb 0x4000 + dma
0 0x4000 fb 0x4000 + fb 0x4000 2 * + dma
#+end_src

The first command copies the 2nd line of the framebuffer over the 1st. (0x4000 is the byte length of one row in the console.)

The second command should copy the 3rd line of the framebuffer over the 2nd. It doesn't complete. ~BroadcomDMAController.awaitChannel~ always sees the DMA as still active.
