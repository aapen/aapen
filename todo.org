There seems to be a docker network problem. Devpod.sh works great on the macOS laptop.
** DONE Discuss device tree & DTBs with Russ
Advantages: 
- Common, open-source mechanism to describe per-board variations in e.g., memory locations of GPIO, UART, mailbox, etc.
- OpenFirmware and Devicetree.org have tons of .dts (source files) available, including all the devices we're interested in.
Disadvantages:
- Variability brings complexity. But so does a generalization / abstraction layer. Will we get enough boost from .dtbs to be worth the added complexity of supporting them?
Unknowns: 
- How would we integrate this with our toolchain? We're already grabbing the .dtbs, but we don't have a compiler to create them from source. Nor do we have a runtime library for parsing them. Do we need to make a Zig module for reading the binary format? Do we need to make a Zig compiler to emit the binary format?

Alternative: Use the .dtb for our reference, but don't parse it in code at boot
Advantages:
- Simplicity. Dev speed (at first).

Disadvantages:
- Difficult to support a plethora of devices.

Maybe we use the dtbs as references for our own use rather than writing code to parse them at boot time.
*** Notes and references
https://github.com/devicetree-org/devicetree-specification

Linux device tree compiler: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dtc/dtc.git
- Can be installed on ubuntu with ~apt install device-tree-compiler~
- The compiler ~dtc~ can also decompile the binaries: ~dtc -I dtb -O dts bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb~ is _very_ interesting!

The low-level boot code that runs on the GPU (start*.elf) seems to
pull the device tree binary into memory for us. By the time ~_start~ is
called, register X0 contains the address of the device tree data. (It
starts with the magic word ~0xd00dfeed~.)

** DONE Figure out how to have the system under test exit QEMU
This will be useful for writing tests
*** Notes & References
The technique needed is "semihosting". This allows certain traps to
act as a syscall to communicate with the emulator.

We can use this to tell QEMU to exit with some particular status code.

It is also possible to use this as another text channel, though we
probably don't want to use it that way. That channel and any messages
sent on it would never be visible when using real hardware.

According to
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/about/emulation.html#semihosting, the
instruction used differs per ARM processor. Our target devices all use
Cortex-A series processors in 64-bit mode, so we use ~HLT #0xF000~ to
invoke the semihosting interface.

Before executing the HLT, we put the "operation number" in W0 and a
single parameter number in X1. After the HLT, X0 holds the return code
from the semihosted call, although we mostly want to exit QEMU so
return is not a concern.

Per https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/about/emulation.html#semihosting,
we can use ~SYS_EXIT~ (0x18) as the operation number. The parameter in
X1 points to a 2 a struct of 2 u64's which indicates /why/ the exit is
taken. We will use ~ADP_Stopped_ApplicationExit~ (0x20026) for
field 1. Field 2 will have the exit status code we want to
signal. QEMU will then use that status code as it's own exit code, so
the parent process can see what the kernel wanted to indicate.

Not needed, we're parsing the real thing.
** DONE Better in-kernel debugging
Problem statement: we can print stack traces but cannot display the function names.
Options considered:
- Use Zig's built-in DwarfInfo functions: doesn't work because it relies on a complete filesystem implementation and the ability to memory-map files. Cannot be separated into "walk the binary" versus "load the binary" parts.
- Include DWARF symbols in the kernel: RPi requires a raw binary, which cannot have sections. DWARF sits in its own section. I considered a hack to insert the DWARF section as raw bytes after stripping the binary, but could not find a useful way to parse the DWARF info anyway.
Option selected:
- Write an separate Zig utility to run at build time;
  - Read the symbol table from an ELF binary. (Since we're running on the build host, we can use the stdlib DwarfInfo functions here)
  - Emit a binary serialized form of a data structure we can use to look up function names.
- Modify the linker script to supply a symbol for the last byte of the kernel text.
- Make sure there is enough space for the symbol table before the BSS and data sections.
- Modify build.zig to run the symbol table utility on the ELF file, then append it to the raw binary.
- Make sure we can locate the symbol table after the last byte of the kernel test.
- Write Zig function to look up an address in that binary symbol table and return the function which contains it.
- Write a Forth word to do that same lookup.
- Write a Forth word to disassemble the function an address is contained within.
- Modify the panic handler to print function names along with the stack addresses

Communication from CPU to GPU is via a "mailbox" interface.

and section 1.2 of "Broadcom BCM2711 ARM Peripherals" (also titled
"Address Map").

publicly documented and does not conform to UHCI, EHCI, or xHCI.

** Interrupt controllers
*** RPi 3
This has the integrated "local" interrupt controller. It maps pending
interrupts to 3 registers, one "basic" pending register which has bits
for the system timer, mailbox, doorbells, a handful of the "GPU
interrupts" (more about that later), and two bits that each indicate
there are more interrupts pending in the regular pending registers.

In the devicetree, nodes with the local controller as ~interrupt-parent~
have ~#interrupt-cells~ set to 2.

| Cell | Meaning          | Symbolic example | Numeric |
|------+------------------+------------------+---------|
|    0 | register seelect | 2                |       2 |
|    1 | IRQ in register  | pwa0             |      13 |

The first cell can be 0, 1 or 2:

| Register select | IRQ Register      |
|-----------------+-------------------|
|               0 | IRQ Basic Pending |
|               1 | IRQ Pending 1     |
|               2 | IRQ Pending 2     |

The ARM peripherals PDF refers to "GPU IRQs" ranging from 0 - 63. The
first 32 of these are signalled in IRQ Pending 1, so the ~interrupts~
property would have a 1 in the first cell. The second batch are in IRQ
Pending 2. So where the PDF says pwa0 is GPU IRQ 45, it is found in
IRQ Pending 2 at bit 13 (13 = 45 - 32).

IRQ Basic Pending has some additional logic:

| IRQ Basic Pending bit | Meaning                                         |
|-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
|                     8 | One or more IRQs are signalled in IRQ Pending 1 |
|                     9 | One or more IRQs are signalled in IRQ Pending 2 |

*** RPi 4
There are two interrupt controllers. The BCM2711 SoC includes a
"local" interrupt controller that directly presents IRQs to the
CPU. It is limited to a fixed set of IRQ bits described in the BCM2711
Peripherals PDF.

The "GIC" is the "global" ("general"?) interrupt controller. It is a
programmable device in its own right, accessed from the CPU via
registers.

In the devicetree, nodes with the GIC as interrupt-parent have
#interrupt-cells set to 3.

| Cell | Meaning        | Symbolic example (bcm2711 mailbox) | Numeric |
|------+----------------+------------------------------------+---------|
|    0 | ??             | ~GIC_SPI~                            |       1 |
|    1 | ??             | 33                                 |      33 |
|    2 | IRQ type flags | ~IRG_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH~                |       4 |

** Dumb stuff about ~zig test~
- The only way to "run all tests" is with a magic incantation that is only documented as [[https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.11.0/#Nested-Container-Tests][Nested container tests]]
#+begin_src
const std = @import("std");
pub const ring = @import("ring.zig");

test {
  std.testing.refAllDecls(@This());
}
#+end_src
- ~zig test~ only takes a single source file
This is related to the "run all tests" papercut. So we either have to loop over all files, running zig test on each, or we have to make sure a single "test parent" file imports every source that has tests in it.
- If the test doesn't do any output, then it will not appear in the summary report. This results in output like:
#+begin_src
Test [1/12] test.parent of all tests...
Test [2/12] test.locate node and property by path...
Test [3/12] test.locate nodes via aliases...
Test [4/12] test.starts empty...
Test [5/12] test.consume what you produce...
Test [6/12] test.consume up to capacity items...
Test [7/12] test.consumer chases producer...
Test [8/12] test.items are overwritten...
Test [12/12] test.Basic stack operation...
All 12 tests passed.  
#+end_src

The solution is to add a single print to the start of each and every test block:
#+begin_src
  std.debug.print("\n", .{});
#+end_src

- ~zig build test~ caches the test runner binary. So if you run it twice, the tests are only executed on the first call. Since caching only uses source files, tests that read resources from files will not be executed a second time even if you change the external file.
- If ~zig build test~ succeeds, it shows no output at all. Not even the "Test [x/y] ..." lines. It has an argument ~--summary~ that takes a parameter. But even ~--summary all~ doesn't show the output.
- Compilation error in any test file results in no tests at all being executed. Sounds OK, except that some compilation errors do not point to the actual source of the problem. E.g.,
#+begin_src
 zig test src/tests.zig
/opt/zig-linux-x86_64-0.11.0/lib/std/mem.zig:4143:9: error: expected []T or *[_]T, passed [*]u8
        @compileError("expected []T or *[_]T, passed " ++ @typeName(sliceType));
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/opt/zig-linux-x86_64-0.11.0/lib/std/mem.zig:4150:59: note: called from here
pub fn sliceAsBytes(slice: anytype) SliceAsBytesReturnType(@TypeOf(slice)) {
                                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#+end_src
- ~zig test~ seems to ignore the ~-freference-trace~ argument. (Discovered while trying to uncover the offending source for the type error in the above example.)
** Zig atomics
Poorly documented. The ordering enum is derived from the C++ standard memory model.
See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order for definitions.
* Open Questions
* Closed Questions
** DONE Should we use device tree? If so, how?
   Answer: Not yet. We need to keep things as simple as possible while we get up and running. Rather than doing a bunch of things dynamically at boot based on hardware discovery, we want to get a single model working first. That means we accept that some things (such as MMIO address) will be built in at compile time.
** DONE Changing a .zig file in a module doesn't trigger recompilation. Why not?
The Makefile didn't even invoke ~zig build~ because there was no rule that depended on the source files themselves.
** DONE Discuss zig weirdness with Russ
It was due to using ~callconv(.Naked)~ on ~kernel_init~. Zig didn't generate a function prelude (which is what "naked" means) but it also assumed there was room on the stack for the variables. Oddly some of the variable accesses were negative offsets from the frame pointer while others were positive offsets from the stack pointer. Since the FP and SP were not where the compiler expected them to be, the variables were all mixed up.
*** With -DOptimize=ReleaseSafe
We get a data fault on the instruction ~str     w11, [x9]~ (compiled at 0x8126c, w11 = 0x24000, x9 = 0xff004)
- x9 points into memory that the linker should have marked as kernel text and the MMU has marked as kernel code (and therefore read-only)
- It's coming from the GPIO code, in the code compiled from
#+begin_src zig
    // Configure GPIO pins for serial I/O
    gpio_function_select_1.modify(.{
        .fsel14 = .alt0,
        .fsel15 = .alt0,
    });
#+end_src

This is supposed to do a raw-read, modify bitfields, and raw-write back to the register address.

Under -DOptimize=ReleaseSafe, that register address is in ~x9~ and is 0xff004 instead of 0x3f000000 + 0x200000 + 0x04

Answer:

The generated assembly code sets up registers x19 and x20 with the GPIO base address, which is later used with an integer index to point to one GPIO register or another. However, the compiler emits code that sets up those registers /before/ it emits the calls to ~pagetable_init()~ and ~mmu_on()~. Those functions (generated by arm64-pgtable-tool) absolutely don't conform to the ARM64 Procedure Calling Standard... they walk all over registers x19 and x20 (and x21 and x22). The solution is to make ~pagetable_init()~ and ~mmu_on()~ conform to the standard which designates x19 through x28 as callee-saved registers.

Followup: That worked.

** DONE Do we need to worry about endianness, or can we just go with whatever RPi uses as a default?
Answer: Best to stick with the default at boot.
Additional note: Devicetree is always written in big-endian format so we have to be careful to convert all types larger than u8 to native byte order.
** DONE Speaking of which, what _does_ it use as a default?
   Answer: Big endian
** DONE How does the RPi 400 keyboard work? Is it just USB connected internally?
   Answer: According to https://www.40percent.club/2020/11/raspberry-pi-400-keyboard-controller.html, the Pi 400 keyboard goes through a custom microcontroller (Holtek HT45R0072) which then goes into one of the 4 USB ports on the builtin controller. So it presents as a USB HID.
** DONE Trying to initialize the framebuffer on real hardware.
It's not working the same way as in the emulator.

** DONE How should we set up a default allocator for zig?
*** Notes and references
std.mem.Allocator uses a struct called "vtable" to create an interface which all allocators implement. ~vtable~ contains function pointers. References to std.mem.Allocator.VTable are littered throughout the standard library.

Whenever looking up the default allocator, stdlib functions first check for ~root.os.page_allocator~. If it is present, it is used. ~root~ is an alias for the top-level struct of application code. This allows us to provide the default implementation.

Approach:
1. At top level, create a member named "os". It will be a struct with (initially) one member ~page_allocator~.
2. That page allocator will be supplied by our OS. The OS will construct it with start of heap and end of heap as provided by the linker.
3. We can use a FixedBufferAllocator from the standard library, with a giant slice of u8 as the whole of RAM.

** DONE Device tree load address from Broadcom firmware
No idea why this is the address: 0x2eff7a00
* Scratch Notes
** USB debugging
- [ ] In QEMU, initializing the host controller triggers a port interrupt, on HW it does not.
  Device enumeration is triggered by that first port interrupt, since the port interrupt causes the hub's first get status call
** bzt has a reset() routine that reboots the board

It uses a register "RSTS"

  #define PM_RSTS         ((volatile unsigned int*)(MMIO_BASE+0x00100020))
