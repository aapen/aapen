** DONE Make codespaces work
- [X] Question: can the codespaces config require an aarch64 container?
        Answer: no it cannot
- [X] Set up container with tools: zig (pinned to a dev snapshot), qemu, gdb-multiarch
** TODO Discuss device tree & DTBs with Russ
Advantages: 
- Common, open-source mechanism to describe per-board variations in e.g., memory locations of GPIO, UART, mailbox, etc.
- OpenFirmware and Devicetree.org have tons of .dts (source files) available, including all the devices we're interested in.
Disadvantages:
- Variability brings complexity. But so does a generalization / abstraction layer. Will we get enough boost from .dtbs to be worth the added complexity of supporting them?
Unknowns: 
- How does the .dtb get fed into the kernel? Is there a firware-level command line stored somewhere before _start is called?
- How would we integrate this with our toolchain? We're already grabbing the .dtbs, but we don't have a compiler to create them from source. Nor do we have a runtime library for parsing them. Do we need to make a Zig module for reading the binary format? Do we need to make a Zig compiler to emit the binary format?

Linux device tree compiler: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dtc/dtc.git
- Can be installed on ubuntu with `apt install device-tree-compiler`
- The compiler `dtc` can also decompile the binaries: `dtc -I dtb -O dts bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb` is _very_ interesting!

The low-level boot code that runs on the GPU (start*.elf) seems to pull the device tree binary into memory for us. By the time `_start` is called, register X0 contains the address of the device tree data. (It starts with the magic word '0xd00dfeed'.)

** DONE Figure out how to have the system under test exit QEMU
This will be useful for writing tests
*** Notes & References
The technique needed is "semihosting". This allows certain traps to
act as a syscall to communicate with the emulator.

We can use this to tell QEMU to exit with some particular status code.

It is also possible to use this as another text channel, though we
probably don't want to use it that way. That channel and any messages
sent on it would never be visible when using real hardware.

According to
https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/about/emulation.html#semihosting, the
instruction used differs per ARM processor. Our target devices all use
Cortex-A series processors in 64-bit mode, so we use ~HLT #0xF000~ to
invoke the semihosting interface.

Before executing the HLT, we put the "operation number" in W0 and a
single parameter number in X1. After the HLT, X0 holds the return code
from the semihosted call, although we mostly want to exit QEMU so
return is not a concern.

Per https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/about/emulation.html#semihosting,
we can use ~SYS_EXIT~ (0x18) as the operation number. The parameter in
X1 points to a 2 a struct of 2 u64's which indicates /why/ the exit is
taken. We will use ~ADP_Stopped_ApplicationExit~ (0x20026) for
field 1. Field 2 will have the exit status code we want to
signal. QEMU will then use that status code as it's own exit code, so
the parent process can see what the kernel wanted to indicate.

** DONE Use the old chainboot kernel & jtag boot from https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials
Stage 1 on the SD card
Stage 2 (the chainboot) downloaded automatically by minipush.rb
Stage 3 (the real kernel) loaded via gdb (connected via openocd)

- [ ] Set up translation tables
- [ ] Reserve the device pages, mark them in TT properly
- [ ] Mark kernel text pages as RX, kernel data (GOT, stack, BSS) as RW/NX
- [ ] Set up interrupt handler tables, point everything to a "panic" that dumps state on UART
- [ ] Transition from EL2 to EL1
** TODO Perform "Hello world" on RPi4 hardware

Read and echo characters.
Polling is fine.
This will actually be the host machine's keyboard in a terminal, proxied to the PL011 UART in the emulated device.

* Open Questions
** Should we use device tree?
** Should we replace the jtag boot & chainloader with our own?
** Do we need to worry about endianness, or can we just go with whatever RPi uses as a default? 
** Speaking of which, what _does_ it use as a default?
